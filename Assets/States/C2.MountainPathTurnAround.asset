  storyText: 'You decide not to risk going up any further and turn around. After
    another hour you''re back where you started. You then take the path leading into
    the jungle. No more water. Running on fumes. After you think you cant possibly
    go any further you hear the sound of moving water. With your last bit of strength
    you lurch your way to toward the source of sound, and find a riverbank. You kneel
    down and start drinking the water., forgetting all about your canteen and it''s
    bacterial filter. You may end up regretting this.
