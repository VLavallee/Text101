  storyText: 'You stop and listen carefully to your surroundings. You hear some rustling
    in the bush just off the trail behind you. Then you see the eyes. Jumping out
    from the foliage, it appears the jaguar had been following you all this time.
    It''s taken your stopping as an invitation to attack. You try to turn to run
    but are frozen with fear. The jaguar makes short work of your squishy human body,
    and soon you are its dinner.



    Game Over.
