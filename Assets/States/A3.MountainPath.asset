  storyText: "You begin the trek toward the mountain, knowing it could be a while
    before you find water. \r\n\r\nAn hour up the path you find a small lookout point
    and try to get your bearings. Despite your vantage point you can only see the
    tops of trees from here. You take another sip of your water. Almost empty.\r\n\r\n\nWhat
    should you do?\r\n\r\n\n1. Keep following the path up the mountain. \r\n\r\n2.
    Turn around and go back down. "
