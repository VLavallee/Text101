  storyText: "You take the jungle pathway. To your surprise it isn't long before
    you hear water. You follow the path and see a riverbank in the distance. You
    carefully move through the foliage toward the water. A quick glance reveals you're
    standing at the base of a small waterfall that must have come from up the mountain.
    You start to fill your canteen when you spot something on the other side. \r\n\r\n\n1.
