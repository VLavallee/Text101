  storyText: "You think the pathway isn't as dangerous as it appears and begin following
    it down, careful to keep your body as close to the cliffside as possible. \r\n\r\nThere's
    a few close calls, but you keep following the trail until it leads you into the
    valley below, where you enter the canopy of the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Continue."
