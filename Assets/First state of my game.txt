Three days until departure. Shouldn't be a problem.
You pull your canteen out from your backpack and take a drink. 
Only enough water for a few more hours in this heat.
The path you've been following branches off in two directions: into the jungle, or up the mountain.


What should I do?

1. Follow the path into the Jungle.

2. Take the trail up the mountain.
